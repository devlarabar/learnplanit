# ðŸŒŽ LearnPlanit
LearnPlanit is the embodiment of a vision for a collaborative learning community. Students can take on the roles of both teachers and learners, offering lessons on subjects covered in their classes. It's a platform where knowledge-sharing fosters a sense of belonging and joy in the educational journey!

With LearnPlanit, students help one another, creating an inclusive and diverse learning environment that benefits both educators and learners. Teaching is not just about conveying knowledge; it's the most effective way to learn.

LearnPlanit was developed out of a deep passion for helping people learn. There is a transformative power in being *community taught*!
